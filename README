This tainted oyster uses the Boehm-Demers-Weiser conservative garbage
collector. It can be obtained here:
http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Hans_Boehm/gc/ , and should be
installed before any attempt to build a tainted oyster. The Makefile is intended to be used on a system with GNU make, gcc, and an inhuman quality of love. 

If your system meets these qualifications, run the commanbd "make" to assemble your oyster. 

If you would like to contribute, question, or converse, please call
405-283-6446 and leave a message with your email address.
