This tainted oyster kit uses glib, so that should be installed before
you make any attempt to build. The Makefile is intended to be used on
a system with GNU make, gcc, and an inhuman quality of love.

If your system meets these qualifications, run the command "make" to
assemble your oyster.

If you would like to contribute, question, or converse, please call
